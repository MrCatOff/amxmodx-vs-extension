# AmxModX Language

Modern VS Code language support for [AMX Mod X](https://www.amxmodx.org/) Pawn — completion, signature help, hover, go-to-definition, `#include` navigation, in-editor diagnostics, and a one-key path to `amxxpc` compilation.

Built on the Language Server Protocol, ships a bundled TypeScript client + server, understands both flat workspaces and [node-amxxpack](https://github.com/hedgefog/node-amxxpack) projects, and localizes into English and Ukrainian.

## Highlights

- **Fluent editing** — completion with parameter tab-stops, signature help, hover documentation, symbol outline, go-to-definition on both identifiers and `#include` targets.
- **Live diagnostics** — a custom Pawn parser flags unmatched braces, malformed `#include`s, unresolved include paths, illegal specifier combinations, and more, as you type.
- **amxxpc integration** — compile the current file with one command, with output routed to a dedicated channel and warnings/errors surfaced in the Problems panel.
- **node-amxxpack aware** — auto-detects `.amxxpack.json` at the workspace root and merges its `input.include` / `include[]` entries into the include-resolution path.
- **Path variables** — `${workspaceFolder}`, `${env:VarName}`, and the rest are expanded in include paths, compiler paths, and output paths.
- **Localized** — UI (settings, commands) and runtime messages (diagnostics, compile output) available in English and Ukrainian; VS Code's UI language picks automatically.

## Requirements

- VS Code `>= 1.95`
- Node `>= 20` (only needed for building from source)
- An `amxxpc` binary for compilation (part of the AMX Mod X scripting distribution)

## Getting started

1. Install the extension from the Marketplace, or build a VSIX from source (see [Development](#development)).
2. Open a folder containing a `.sma` or `.inc` file — the extension activates automatically.
3. Point `amxmodx.compiler.executablePath` at your `amxxpc` binary (or drop `amxxpc` next to your `.sma` and use the *Compile Local* variant).
4. Run **AmxModX: Compile plugin** from the command palette. Output lands in the "AmxModX Compiler" output channel; warnings and errors show up in the Problems panel.

For workspaces built with [node-amxxpack](https://github.com/hedgefog/node-amxxpack), just drop a `.amxxpack.json` at the root — the extension picks up the include paths defined there without any extra configuration. See the [zombie-panic sample project](https://github.com/hedgefog/cs-zombie-panic) for a real-world layout.

## Commands

| Command ID | Title | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `amxmodx.compile` | AmxModX: Compile plugin | Compiles the active `.sma` with `amxmodx.compiler.executablePath`. |
| `amxmodx.compileLocal` | AmxModX: Compile plugin (local amxxpc) | Same, but uses an `amxxpc` binary sitting next to the source file. Useful for portable AMX Mod X distributions. |

## Settings

All settings live under the `amxmodx.*` namespace.

### Project

| Setting | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `amxmodx.project.type` | `"auto" \| "default" \| "amxxpack"` | `"auto"` | How the workspace layout should be interpreted. `auto` uses amxxpack if a config file is present, otherwise falls back to `amxmodx.compiler.*`. `default` ignores the config file; `amxxpack` requires it. |
| `amxmodx.project.configFile` | `string` | `.amxxpack.json` | Path (relative to the workspace root, or absolute) to the amxxpack config file. |

### Language service

| Setting | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `amxmodx.language.reparseInterval` | `number` (ms) | `1500` | Debounce window before the server reparses on typing. |
| `amxmodx.language.webApiLinks` | `boolean` | `true` | Turn `#include` filenames into clickable document links. |

### Compiler

| Setting | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `amxmodx.compiler.executablePath` | `string` | `""` | Path to `amxxpc`. Supports `${workspaceFolder}`, `${env:VarName}`, and the other standard VS Code path variables. |
| `amxmodx.compiler.includePaths` | `string[]` | `[]` | Extra directories searched for `#include` files. Merged with amxxpack-derived paths when applicable. |
| `amxmodx.compiler.options` | `string[]` | `[]` | Extra command-line flags forwarded to `amxxpc`. |
| `amxmodx.compiler.outputType` | `"source" \| "path"` | `"source"` | Where the compiled `.amxx` file lands — next to the source, or in the directory named by `outputPath`. |
| `amxmodx.compiler.outputPath` | `string` | `""` | Destination directory when `outputType` is `path`. |
| `amxmodx.compiler.showInfoMessages` | `boolean` | `false` | Show information-level messages in addition to warnings and errors. |
| `amxmodx.compiler.reformatOutput` | `boolean` | `true` | Rewrite `amxxpc`'s output into a cleaner, VS Code-friendly form in the output channel. |
| `amxmodx.compiler.switchToOutput` | `boolean` | `true` | Focus the output channel automatically when a compile starts. |

## Localization

The extension ships with two locale bundles:

- **English** — `package.nls.json` + `l10n/bundle.l10n.json` (default, always loaded).
- **Ukrainian** — `package.nls.uk.json` + `l10n/bundle.l10n.uk.json`.

VS Code picks the right bundle based on the installed language pack (Command Palette → *Configure Display Language*). To contribute another locale, drop `package.nls.<locale>.json` at the repo root and `l10n/bundle.l10n.<locale>.json` alongside — no code changes required.

## Development

The client and server are both TypeScript, bundled with esbuild.

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run build        # bundle client + server into dist/
npm run watch        # rebuild on change
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint         # ESLint 9 flat config
npm test             # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:integration   # @vscode/test-electron integration tests
npm run package      # produce a .vsix via @vscode/vsce
```

Layout:

```
src/
  client/            # VS Code extension host code (activation, commands, LSP client)
    compiler/        # amxxpc invocation, output routing
  server/            # LSP server: parser + feature providers
    features/        # completion, definition, hover, signature help, ...
    parser/          # tokenizer + parser
    workspace/       # include resolver, dependency manager, symbol collector
  shared/            # cross-boundary code (settings, path variables, l10n, amxxpack config)
l10n/                # runtime string bundles (l10n.t())
package.nls*.json    # static contribution translations
syntaxes/            # TextMate grammars
snippets/            # user-facing code snippets
```

Loading the extension in a debug window: open this folder in VS Code and press `F5`.
